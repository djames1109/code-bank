<h1>Project Zephyr</h1>

<p>
Project Zephyr is a practice microservice system built to explore modern development with Quarkus and Java 21.
It’s designed as a banking-style test project that brings together core enterprise concepts like microservice communication, security, caching, idempotency, multi-datasource persistence, and containerized deployment.

The project serves as a learning environment to understand how different parts of a distributed system work together —
from RESTful APIs and Kafka-based events to database integrations, Redis caching, and JWT authentication.
